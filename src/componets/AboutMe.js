            . My interest in development started back in 2016 when I decided to
            try editing Jerusalem Baptist website â€” turns out ads among other
            buttons together directed me to a number of possibilities. A button
            taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

            Days and struggles passed which finaly got to University of Malawi
            also known as Chancellor College past days.I had to conceptualise
            everything a developer needs to know about software develoment. I
            have had privileges of being part of a few project to grasp what the
            industry is all about. My main focus now is developing applications
            on web, mobile and desktop applications that would enhance lives
            better.
